<span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="caps">t</span> having been resolved in a general
Council of War, held at
<i>Spanish</i> Town, to prevent, if
possible, the <i>French</i> Fleet joining the
Enemy before any Expedition should
be undertaken by Land: the <i>Wolf</i>
Sloop, Captain <i>Dandridge</i>, was dispatched
up to <i>Port Louis</i>, to observe
if the Fleet was in that Port:
And on the 22d of <i>January</i>, which
was the soonest the Fleet could be
got ready for the Sea, Sir <i>Chaloner
Ogle</i> and his Division sailed out of
<span class="pagenum">[2]</span><i>Port Royal</i> Harbour; and two Days
after Mr. <i>Lestock</i> and his Division;
and on the <i>Monday</i> following the
Admiral with the rest of the Squadron
(leaving behind him the <i>Falmouth</i>
and <i>Litchfield</i> to bring up the
Transports;) but the Land Breeze
failing, and a great Swell rolling
down, obliged them to anchor at
the <i>Keys</i> (where the <i>Augusta</i> drove
ashore, and beat off her Rudder,
and great part of her Keel.) On the
28th the Admiral weighed Anchor,
and plied up to Windward, and the
31st joined Sir <i>Chaloner Ogle</i> and
Mr. <i>Lestock</i> with their Divisions off
<i>Port Morant</i>, and the Day following
was joined by the <i>Falmouth</i>,
<i>Litchfield</i>, and Transports. <i>February</i>
the 7th the Fleet made Cape <i>Tiberoon</i>
on the Island <i>Hispaniola</i>, and
off there was joined by the <i>Cumberland</i>,
Captain <i>Stewart</i>, from <i>Lisbon</i>,
(who had been separated from the
<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>Fleet in the Storm the 1st of <i>November</i>)
and the next Day the <i>Wolf</i>
Sloop came into the Fleet<a href="#noteA" name="noterefA"><sup> [<i>A</i>]</sup></a> and
brought with her a <i>French</i> Sloop.
The 13th the Fleet anchored at the
Isle of <i>Vache</i>, about two Leagues
to the Westward of <i>Port Louis</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>where they stayed but four Days,
having gained Intelligence the <i>French</i>
Fleet was divided, and sailed (the
Marquis <i>D'Antin</i> and twelve Sail
being gone for <i>Old France</i>, and Mr.
<i>Rochefieulle</i> and six Sail for <i>Petit
Guavas</i>) upon which the Fleet went
and anchored in <i>Tiberoon</i>, <i>Donna Maria</i>, and <i>Irish</i> Bays, to Wood
and Water; and on the 25th sailed
from thence, when the <i>Weymouth</i>,
<i>Experiment</i>, and <i>Spence</i> Sloop, were
dispatched ahead over to <i>Carthagena</i>,
to sound <i>Punta Canoa</i> Bay,
for the safer anchoring the Fleet,
which arrived there the 5th of
<i>March</i> in the Evening; and three
Days after the same Ships, together
with the <i>Dunkirk</i>, were ordered by
the Admiral down off <i>Boccachica</i>,
to sound and see if the Fleet might
safely anchor there, and how near
Ships might come to batter the Forts
of <i>St. Philip</i> and <i>St. Jago</i>; and so
<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>soon as the Admiral had received
the Reports from the Commanders
of these Ships, a Council of War
was held, wherein it was resolved to
send three eighty Gun Ships, the
<i>Norfolk</i>, Captain <i>Graves</i>, the <i>Shrewsbury</i>,
Captain <i>Townsend</i>, and the
<i>Russell</i>, Captain <i>Norris</i>, to batter
the Forts abovementioned; the
<i>Princess Amelia</i>, Captain <i>Hemmington</i>,
to fire against the Fascine Battery,
and the <i>Litchfield</i>, Captain
<i>Cleveland</i>, against the little Battery
of <i>Chamba</i>; (but these two last the
Enemy had abandoned) and accordingly
the 9th in the Morning they
weighed Anchor from <i>Punta Canoa</i>
Bay, together with Sir <i>Chaloner
Ogle</i>, and the rest of his Division,
(he being to command the Attack)
and about two Hours afterwards, the
Admiral and the rest of the Fleet
got under sail: At Noon the <i>Norfolk</i>,
<i>Russell</i>, and <i>Shrewsbury</i> began
<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>to cannonade the Forts, and in about
three Hours time drove the Enemy
from their Guns, and obliged them
to abandon their Forts<a href="#noteB" name="noterefB"><sup>[<i>B</i>]</sup></a>: Immediately
on this Sir <i>Chaloner Ogle</i>
made the Signal for landing the
Troops, which was repeated by the
Admiral, who was just come to an
Anchor, (a little to the Eastward)
and about five o'clock in the Evening,
a Body of Troops were landed
without Opposition; but the General
not thinking the Body sufficient,
<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>(he landing with them) embarked
again in the Boats, and sent for
more<a href="#noteC" name="noterefC"><sup>[<i>C</i>]</sup></a>. About eight o'Clock
they landed again, and went and
took Possession of the Forts of <i>St.
Philip</i> and <i>St. Jago</i>, and about nine
the Bomb-ketches were carried in
Shore, and began to play on the
Castle of <i>Boccachica</i>. The three
next Days were spent in landing the
remainder of the Forces, the Baggage,
<i>&#38;c.</i><a href="#noteD" name="noterefD"><sup>[<i>D</i>]</sup></a> and by the 16th
<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>all the Cannon, Mortars, and Ordnance
Stores were landed<a href="#noteE" name="noterefE"><sup>[<i>E</i>]</sup></a>. But
the principal Engineer not arriving
till the 15th, no Spot was pitched
<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>upon for raising a Battery<a href="#noteF" name="noterefF"><sup>[<i>F</i>]</sup></a> against
the Enemy, so that the clearing a
few Bushes away down by the Water
Side, for to pitch their Tents,
was all the material Work the Army
<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>did for near a Week; and the Enemy
was contented to let them be
pretty quiet, only now and then
firing a Shot, until they opened a
Bomb-Battery of four Mortars and
some Royals on the 17th<a href="#noteG" name="noterefG"><sup>[<i>G</i>]</sup></a>, and
then the Fascine Battery on the
<span class="pagenum">[11]</span><i>Barradera</i> Side annoyed them greatly,
and particularly the Camp, so
that they were obliged to remove it
several Paces off.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#noteH" name="noterefH"><sup>[<i>H</i>]</sup></a>This being represented to
the Admiral, Orders were given for
<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>all Boats of the Squadron to be ready
at Midnight (manned and armed)
to go to surprize the <i>Barradera</i> Battery,
and the Command given to
Captain <i>Boscawen</i><a href="#noteI" name="noterefI"><sup>[<i>I</i>]</sup></a>, in which
they happily succeeded, spiked up
<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>all the Guns; burnt the Carriages,
Platforms, and Guard-house; destroyed
<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>the Magazine, and took
several Prisoners<a href="#noteK" name="noterefK"><sup>[<i>K</i>]</sup></a>. The next
Morning, as soon as it was Day, the
Enemy from <i>Boccachica</i> began to
fire warmly at the Bomb-Battery, (as
if they were angry at what happened
the Night before) though without
doing them any particular Damage;
and as they were sensible of
the Usefulness and advantageous
Situation of this Battery, they set
busily about repairing some Part of
it, and on the 20th had built up
some Embrazures and mounted two
Guns, and fired them on the Bomb-Battery
again, which the Admiral
observing, ordered the <i>Rippon</i>, a
sixty Gun ship, to go and anchor as
near it, as possible, and keep firing
<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>on it to prevent the Enemy's
working on it any farther<a href="#noteL" name="noterefL"><sup>[<i>L</i>]</sup></a>, so
that all the next Day the Army was
in a State of Tranquillity, and on
<i>Sunday</i> the 22d their grand Battery
of twenty Guns being finished,
about eight o'Clock in the Morning
began to play very briskly on the
Castle, as did the Bomb-Battery, and
thirty or forty Cohorns and Royals
planted on the Platform behind the
<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>Cannon<a href="#noteM" name="noterefM"><sup>[<i>M</i>]</sup></a>, which the Enemy
returned as briskly from the Castle,
the four Ships<a href="#noteN" name="noterefN"><sup>[<i>N</i>]</sup></a> (Don <i>Blass</i>'s in<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
particular) <i>St. Joseph</i>'s, and some
few Guns from the <i>Barradera</i>, so
that the Work was warm on both
Sides. On the 23d the <i>Boyne</i>, <i>Suffolk</i>,
<i>Tilbury</i>, <i>Prince Frederick</i>, and
<i>Hampton Court</i>, were ordered in
<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>against <i>Boccachica</i> to cannonade<a href="#noteO" name="noterefO"><sup>[<i>O</i>]</sup></a>;
but the <i>Boyne</i> having anchored so
far to Leeward, as to lie exposed to
the whole Fire of the Enemy's Ships,
and <i>St. Joseph</i>'s Battery, was much
shattered, and ordered off again that
Night. The <i>Prince Frederick</i> and
<i>Hampton Court</i>, sharing the Fire of
the Enemy, that had been employed
against the <i>Boyne</i>, were also much
shattered by Morning, when they
were likewise ordered to come off;
the former having lost her Captain,
<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>and both many Men killed and
wounded. The <i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Tilbury</i>
happening to anchor well to the
Northward, lay battering till the
next Evening (and with some Success,
particularly against the Breach)
when the Admiral sent Orders for
them to draw off. The Army now
began to look on the Breach as accessible,
but the Guns in the <i>Barradera</i>
Battery, being able to annoy
them in their Attack, a Representation
thereof was made to the Admiral,
who immediately directed
the <i>Princess Amelia</i>, <i>Litchfield</i>, and
<i>Shoreham</i>, to go in, and anchor as
nigh it as possible, and sent the Boats
of the Squadron again mann'd and
arm'd, under the Command of Captain
<i>Watson</i> to destroy it<a href="#noteP" name="noterefP"><sup>[<i>P</i>]</sup></a>, which
<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>they did effectually, and with scarce
any Opposition; the greatest part of
the Guns in <i>Boccachica</i> Castle being
now dismounted, the Army
thought proper to entertain the Enemy's
Ships, by widening five or six
Embrazures of their Battery, and
playing some Guns on them, which
the Ships as civilly returned, 'till
Night closed in, and firing ceased on
both Sides<a href="#noteQ" name="noterefQ">]<sup>[<i>Q</i></sup></a>. The 25th in the
Morning it was discovered, the Enemy
<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>had been throwing up some
Fascine Works on the Ramparts;
however as they had not moved away
any Rubbish from the Breach,
it was resolved this Evening to attack
it by Storm<a href="#noteR" name="noterefR"><sup>[<i>R</i>]</sup></a>, and accordingly
soon after Sun-set a Body of
Troops marched up and mounted
<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>the Breach undiscovered, and quietly
took Possession of the Castle, the
Enemy flying out at the Gate so soon
as they saw the Troops on the
Ramparts, and heard their Huzza's.
Those aboard their Ships were in the
utmost Consternation at such a sudden
and successful Event, and with
<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>all precipitate Surprize betook themselves
to their Boats, setting Fire to
one of their Ships, and sinking two
others. At the same time the Attack
was to be made on the Castle,
(in order to divide the Enemy's
Forces) the Admiral had given Orders
<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>for the Attack of the Castle of
<i>St. Joseph</i> by Boats, and sent them
away under the Command of Captain
<i>Knowles</i>, who took Possession
of it about ten a Clock at Night,
the Enemy abandoning it after firing
some Guns: The Boats afterwards
went and took Possession of
the <i>Galicia</i>, the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral's
Ship, and then went to Work on
cutting the Boom<a href="#noteS" name="noterefS"><sup>[<i>S</i>]</sup></a>, and moving
the <i>Galicia</i> out of the Channel; and
<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>next Morning the Admiral in the
<i>Princess Caroline</i>, the <i>Worcester</i>,
and some other Ships sailed into the
Harbour of <i>Carthagena</i>, and the
whole Fleet and Transports continued
to sail and warp in as fast as conveniently
they could. The Enemy
seeing the Admiral and several Ships
got into the Harbour, began to expect
<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>a Visit at <i>Castillo Grande</i> soon,
and as <i>Mancinilla</i> Fort lay opposite
to it within Gun-shot, and was not
capable of making any great Defence,
they thought proper to destroy
it, lest we should take Possession
of it, and so batter the Castle.
On the 28th the Admiral being informed
of two small Batteries that
guarded the <i>Passa Cavallos</i><a href="#noteT" name="noterefT"><sup>[<i>T</i>]</sup></a>, sent
the <i>Weymouth</i> and <i>Cruiser</i> Sloop to
demolish them, and take all the
Imbarkations and Canoes that were
there; and disposed the Fire-ships
and small Frigates round the Harbour,
<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>to guard every Pass and Creek,
in order to cut off any Supplies going
to the Town. On the 30th
the Rear-Admiral and several Ships
turned up the Harbour, and anchored
a small Distance from <i>Castillo
Grande</i>, where the Enemy made a
Shew of preparing to receive them;<a href="#noteV" name="noterefV"><sup>[<i>V</i>]</sup></a>
and in order to stop the Fleet
here, had sunk seven Ships across
the Channel, and moored two of
their Men of War, the <i>Conquestodore</i>
of sixty six Guns, and the <i>Dragon</i>
<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>of sixty. The 31st early in the
Morning, Captain <i>Knowles</i> observed
the enemy's two Men of War sunk,
and not perceiving any Men in the
Castle went and acquainted Sir
<i>Chaloner Ogle</i>, that it was his Opinion
the Enemy had abandoned
<i>Castillo Grande</i>, who immediately
ordered him to weigh Anchor, and
run in with his Ship, and fire on it,
which he did; and the Castle making
no return, he sent his Boats ashore,
and took Possession of it, and
hoisted the <i>English</i> Flag: And on
the Admiral's receiving Intelligence,
he ordered a proper Number of
Forces to garison it<a href="#noteW" name="noterefW"><sup>[<i>W</i>]</sup></a>. The
<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>next Day Captain <i>Griffin</i>, and Captain
<i>Rentone</i>, were sent to see if it
was possible to get past the Enemy's
Ships they had sunk, and finding the
<i>Conquestodore</i>'s Stern afloat, the <i>Burford</i>
warped up, and cut the Stern
Moorings, and hove her round, which
opened a fair Channel, and the
Bomb-Ketches, and two twenty
Gun Ships went through. By this
Time the Admiral, and greatest Part
of the Squadron, were come up the
Harbour. Mr. <i>Lestock</i> and his Division
was left at <i>Boccachica</i>, with
Orders to reimbark the Forces,
and Cannon as fast as possible. The
second in the Morning the Bomb-Ketches
began to play on the Town,
and some of the Guns of <i>Castillo
<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>Grande</i>, that were cleared, fired on
a <i>French</i> Ship that lay up at the
Head of the Harbour<a href="#noteX" name="noterefX"><sup>[<i>X</i>]</sup></a>, upon
which the Enemy set fire to her,
and she burned the greatest Part of
the Day. Next Day the <i>Weymouth</i>
getting through the Channel, the
Town began to fire on her, but
without doing any material Damage.
Great Part of the Transports with
the Troops being now come up the
Harbour, this Night the <i>Weymouth</i>,
the three Fire-ships, and the <i>Cruiser</i>
Sloop, being designed by the Admiral
to cover the landing of the
Forces, warped over on the other
Side the Harbour undiscovered by
<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>the Enemy, who in the Morning, to
shew their Resentment, gave them
a Salvo of what Cannon fronted that
Way; (but firing through the Bushes
did no Execution) the <i>Cruiser</i> Sloop
drawing but little Water, warped
up a Creek, and a Party of the
Enemy from a Breast-work they had
thrown up, fired smartly on her
with their Musketry, but were quickly
dislodged, a brisk fire, chiefly with
Grape Shot, having been kept all
Night to scour the Woods. About
5 o'Clock next Morning, being the
5th, the Forces were landed<a href="#noteY" name="noterefY"><sup>[<i>Y</i>]</sup></a>,
and in their marching up from the
Waterside had a small Skirmish with
some of the Enemy's Troops that
<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>had made a Lodgment in the Woods,
whom they soon put to Flight; and
about a Mile further were attacked
a second Time, but the Enemy as
soon shewed their Backs again. Finding
the Country open hereabouts,
<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>the Army did not chuse to make any
further Advances, so they pitched
<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>on a Place for encamping, and
the Evening sent a Party up to <i>La
Papa</i> to take Possession of that, if
the Enemy had abandoned it<a href="#noteZ" name="noterefZ"><sup>[<i>Z</i>]</sup></a>.
In the mean while all possible Dispatch
was made in landing the Baggage,
Provision, Cannon, Ammunition,
<i>&#38;c.</i><a href="#noteAA" name="noterefAA"><sup>[<i>A</i>]</sup></a> which the Enemy
surprisingly suffered, notwithstanding
the landing Place was within
reach of the Guns of <i>St. Lazare</i>;
yet they fired but seldom, for it appeared
afterwards their Attention was
<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>more towards their own Safety, (or
'tis certain they might have done a
great deal of Mischief;) for whilst
the Army were employed, and getting
their things ashore, the Enemy
were as busy in making a Fascine
Battery of four Pieces of Cannon
on the Brow of the Hill, and carrying
on a Trench (or Line) round
the Foot of the Castle, which they
completed in a very short Time<a href="#noteBB" name="noterefBB"><sup>[<i>B</i>]</sup></a>,
quicker than the Army could make
<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>a Battery only for three Mortars,
and throw up a small Breast-work
for their Advance Guards. But no
Care was yet taken to cut off the
Communication between Town and
Country<a href="#noteCC" name="noterefCC"><sup>[<i>C</i>]</sup></a>. Complaints now began
to be made, that the Number
<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>of Sick was greatly increased in the
Camp; upon which the Admiral
immediately supplied them with a
Detachment of Lord <i>James Cavendish</i>
and Colonel <i>Bland</i>'s Regiments,
<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>that had remained aboard the Ships
as part of their Compliments, and
a Body of such <i>Americans</i> as were
fit for Duty<a href="#noteDD" name="noterefDD"><sup>[<i>D</i>]</sup></a>.
<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>Upon this Reinforcement, and
the Apprehensions of the rainy Seasons,
which were daily expected,
on the eighth in the Afternoon a
Land Council of War was held <a href="#noteEE" name="noterefEE"><sup>[<i>E</i>]</sup></a>,
wherein it was resolved to attack the
Castle and Trenches of <i>St. Lazare</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>(without first raising a Battery to
make a Breach) and to this Resolution
the Engineer joined in Opinion<a href="#noteFF" name="noterefFF"><sup>[<i>F</i>]</sup></a>.
Accordingly on the ninth
in the Morning between three and
four o'Clock the Attack was made,
and maintained very resolutely on
both Sides till between six and seven,
when the Enemy obliged the
Forces to retreat after a considerable
Loss of Officers and Men<a href="#noteGG" name="noterefGG"><sup>[<i>G</i>]</sup></a>. After
the Miscarriage of this Scheme
<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>(which was the occasion of the Town's
not being taken) the Army sickened
surprisingly fast, and those that were
killed being esteemed the Flower of
<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>the Flock, the General declared he
was no longer in a Condition to
<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>defend himself, much more to carry
on a Siege against the Place, and
hoped, if the Admiral (who had
ordered the <i>Weymouth</i> to erect a
<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>Bomb-Battery, which was finished
and played in two Days) expected
any Thing to be done, he would
order some Ships in to cannonade
the Town<a href="#noteHH" name="noterefHH"><sup>[<i>H</i>]</sup></a>, otherwise desired
these Things might be considered in
a general Council of War, of Sea and
<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>Land Officers, and accordingly on
the 15th a Council of War was held,
who came to a Resolution (upon the
General's Representation of the bad
State of the Army)<a href="#noteII" name="noterefII"><sup>[<i>I</i>]</sup></a>, to have
the Cannon and Forces reimbarked
with all convenient Speed, and the
17th in the Night the Troops were
accordingly<a href="#noteKK" name="noterefKK"><sup>[<i>K</i>]</sup></a> taken off the Shore.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>Nothing remained now but to get
the Fleet and Transports ready for
Sea, and to demolish the Castles and
Fortifications already taken, which
last was effectually done by blowing
them up, and by the 12th of <i>May</i>
the whole Fleet and Forces had taken
leave of <i>Carthagena</i>.

APPENDIX.
</h2>


<p>
<span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="caps">n</span> order more fully and clearly to form a
Judgment of the foregoing Expedition,
it may not be improper to subjoin this
Narrative of the Enemy's Situation, Strength,
and Disposition at <i>Carthagena</i>, as the Fleet
and Forces found them on their Arrival there:
And in order to carry it on agreeable to the
Advances that were made, begin with a
<i>Disposition</i> of <i>Punta Canoa</i> Bay, where the
Fleet first anchored. This Bay is about five
Miles to the North West of the City of
<i>Carthagena</i>, but not an extraordinary good
anchoring Place, as the Water is shoal a
great Way off the Shore, and the Coast
pretty strait, that Ships are not much sheltered
with the Point of Land, from the
Violence of the Breezes that generally blow.
In the Bottom of this Bay is an Entrance
into the great Lake of <i>Jesea</i>, (called the
<i>Boquilla</i>) where the Enemy had a small
<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>Fascine Battery of four Pieces of Cannon,
and kept a Guard; but upon the Fleet's Arrival,
(and during the Time they continued
to lie there) a considerable Number of the
Enemy's Forces, both Horse and Foot, kept
constantly there, expecting a Descent. The
next Place of Note was the <i>Cruizes</i>, where
the Enemy kept a Guard ordinarily of a
hundred Men: This Place is about half Way
from the <i>Boquilla</i> to the Town, and guards
a narrow Creek or Pass from the Town to
the Lake, called <i>Passa de Juan D'Ingola</i>,
through which Supplies come in Canoes from
the other Side of the Lake to the Town:
As for the City itself, Nature has fortified
that against any Attempt by Sea, the Water
shoaling near a League off, and the Shore
being plentifully bounded with Rocks; besides,
the Sea is very seldom smooth, so that
it is difficult at all Times landing. However,
as the Enemy knew the Bravery of those
they had to deal with, they began to wall
this Side of the Town, and make a Ravelin
in the Middle, there being already a strong
Bastion at each End. <i>Bocca Grande</i> being
the next Place the Enemy suspected an Attempt
might be designed, had posted two
of their Men of War, the <i>Conquestodore</i> of
sixty six Guns, and the <i>Dragon</i> of sixty to
guard it, and began two Fascine Batteries,
<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>one on each Point of the Entrance. This
Passage, called <i>Bocca Grande</i>, was formerly
the principal Entrance into the Harbour,
but by Storms, and the Force of the Sea,
a Bank was thrown up, which quite closed
the Entrance, and then it was called <i>Bocca
Serrada</i>; but as strange Revolutions are frequent
in these Countries, within these few
Years this Passage has broke out again, and
there is now nine or ten Foot Water in it.
About three Miles below this, on the Island
of <i>Terra Bomba</i>, was a small Fort of four
Guns, called <i>Battery de Chamba</i>; and half
a Mile further, a Fascine Battery of twelve
Guns, (both of these the Enemy had abandoned.)
The next Places of Defence were
the Forts of <i>St. Philip</i> and <i>St. Jago</i>, one
of seven Guns, the other of fifteen, which
served as Redoubts to the Castle of <i>Boccachica</i>.
One of these Forts was built on the
Rock <i>Ponti</i> landed on, and probably to
prevent any one's landing there again, (especially
so easily as he did.) The Castle of
<i>Boccachica</i> was the Enemy's chief Dependance,
as it guarded the Entrance into the
Harbour. It is a regular Square, with four
Bastions well built, and was capable of
making a stout Defence if well garisoned,
and would have been much stronger had the
Glacis and Counterscarp been finished. There
<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>was mounted in it eighty two Guns, and
three Mortars, and the Enemy had cleared
three or four hundred Yards of the Woods
round it, to prevent Approaches being made
undiscovered, (as <i>Ponti</i> did in 1697.) On
the other Side the Harbour's Mouth was a
Fascine Battery of fifteen Guns, called the
<i>Barradera</i>; and in a small Bay a back of
that, another Battery of four Guns; and
facing the Entrance of the Harbour, on a
small flat Island, stood <i>St. Joseph</i>'s Fort of
twenty one Guns: From this Fort to <i>Boccachica</i>
Castle a Boom and Cables were fixed
across, fastened with three large Anchors
at each End; and just within the Boom was
moored in a Line four Men of War, the
<i>Galicia</i> of sixty six Guns, (aboard which
was the Admiral Don <i>Blass D'Leso</i>,) the
<i>Africa</i> and <i>St. Carlos</i>, each of sixty six
Guns, and the <i>St. Philip</i> of seventy Guns,
which spread the Width of the Harbour's
Mouth, that there was not room for a Ship
either to pass a head or a stern of them, so
that it was impossible for shipping to force
an Entrance into the Harbour; and had the
Enemy here made a Defence equal to the admirable
Disposition they had formed, it must
have been a difficult Task for the Fleet to
have got in, even after <i>Boccachica</i> Castle was
taken. About four or five Miles from hence
<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>is a Creek, or Passage, that parts the Grand
<i>Baru</i> from the Main called <i>Passa Cavallos</i>,
through which there is Water enough for
small Vessels: This Pass the Enemy had
defended with two Fascine Batteries, one of
eight Guns, the other of four, as well to
protect their own Imbarkations that come
this Way with Provisions from <i>Tolu</i>, and the
River <i>Sina</i>, as to prevent any Attempts being
made this Way. The next place of Defence
was <i>Castillo Grande</i>, which is about
eight Miles up the Harbour. This Castle
is a regular Square with four Bastions, strong
and well built, and defended to the Land by
a wet Ditch and Glacis proper, and one
Face towards the Sea has a Raveline, and a
double Line of Guns. This Castle can
mount sixty one Guns, though there was
but fifty seven in it. Opposite to this was a
Horse-shoe Battery of twelve Guns, called
<i>Mancinilla</i>; and in the Middle between these
two Forts is a large Shoal with not above
two or three Foot Water on it, which divides
the Channel into two: In each of
these Passages were Ships sunk across, to prevent,
if possible, the Fleet's getting by; for
that Part of the Harbour above these Castles
is a perfect Bason, and seems rather like one
Harbour within another, so that if some of
the Ships could not have got past to have covered
<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>the Troops landing (where they did)
they must have marched several Miles, and
been greatly exposed; besides, it would have
been excessively difficult transporting the
Cannon, neither could the Bomb-Ketches
have got near enough this Way to have diverted
the Town; so that the Intent of this
Disposition was exceeding good, had it been
effectually executed, (but Fear made the
Enemy work in too much Hurry.) Near
three Miles further up the Harbour, on two
flat sandy Islands, or Keys, stands the famous
City of <i>Carthagena</i>, and <i>Himani</i>, called
its Suburbs, which are both irregular Figures,
but well fortified to the Land with
strong Bastions at proper Distances, and
Lakes and Morasses running round them;
and the Water at the Head of the Harbour
shoal so far off, that Ships cannot come
near enough to do any material Execution
with their Guns, which adds much to its
Strength.
</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>
About a Quarter of a Mile from the
Gate of <i>Himani</i>, on a pretty high Eminence,
stands the Castle (or Redoubt) of <i>St.
Lazare</i>, which in itself is but trifling, but
its Situation very advantageous, and by some
new Works lately thrown up much strengthened.
This Redoubt overlooks all the Town,
<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>but has a Brow of a Hill (about four hundred
Yards from it) that overlooks it as
much, and entirely commands it, where
would have been a proper Place to have
raised a Battery, which the Enemy full
well knew, for they constantly kept a
Guard there, to observe the Army's Motions.
As it was this famous Castle put an
End to the Siege of <i>Carthagena</i>, a particular
Description of it may not be unwelcome.
</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>
The Hill it stands on is about fifty or sixty
Foot high, naturally steep, but made more
so by the Earth out of the Trenches and
Lines being thrown over the Brow. The
Castle is a Square of about fifty Foot, with
three Demi-Bastions, two Guns in each Face,
one in each Flank, and three in each Curtain.
When the Army first landed, there was no
material Works about the Castle, but a
Fascine Battery, of five Guns at the North
End of the Hill, facing the Brow of the
commanding Hill abovementioned; but
whilst they were encamping, <i>&#38;c.</i> the Enemy
cut Lines round the Foot of the Castle,
and erected another Fascine-Battery on the
South Brow of the Hill, and brought four
Guns out of the North Battery, and mounted
in this, as it commanded the Ascent of the
Hill best; these Lines ran in Traverses, and
<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>communicated from Battery to Battery, and
were a better Defence, and much stronger,
than all the other Works together. After
the Attack, the Enemy being able to judge
where their Foible lay, mounted two Guns in
the Lines, against the angular Point of one
of the Bastions (which was not defended)
where the Troops ascended the Hill, and to
the South Part of the Hill lengthened their
Lines, and made a Stair-case up the Hill, to
the Fascine-Battery, and a Breast-work cross
the Road, from the Foot of the Hill down
to the Water-side, which effectually blocked
themselves up, and was a Security against
the Army's making a second Attack, and
coming at them the right Way, as they
might have done at first, had they taken the
Guide's Advice. The Side next the Town is
quite defenceless, and the Way into the Castle
up a Ladder, on that Side, which draws up,
like a Bridge.
</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>
From the several Examinations of Deserters
it appeared, the Number of the Enemy
did not exceed four thousand, (regular Forces,
Seamen, Militia, Blacks, and Indians included)
and daily Experience convinced us of the
Goodness of their Engineers, Bombardiers,
and Gunners, as Desertion and Cowardice
convinced us of the Badness of others.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>Having given an Account of the Enemy's
Situation and Strength, it may likewise be
necessary to relate some Account of the State
of the Army, and what pretty Instruments
and Materials they were furnished withal.
That the whole Body of the Troops, that
came from <i>England</i> (unless two Regiments)
were raw, new raised, undisciplined Men,
is a Fact known to every one; and the
greatest Part of the Officers commanding
them, either young Gentlemen whose Quality
or Interest entitled them to Preferment,
or abandoned Wretches of the Town, whose
Prostitution had made them useful on some
dirty Occasion, and by Way of Reward
were provided for in the Army; but both
these Sorts of Gentlemen had never seen any
Services, consequently, knew not properly
how to act, or command; so that the worthy
old experienced Officers, who had served
long and well, underwent a continual Hardship,
in teaching and disciplining a young
raw Army, at a Time when they were on
Service, and every one ought to have been
Masters of their Trade, instead of having
it to learn; and thus, by more frequently
exposing themselves, most of them were
knocked on the Head. As for the <i>American</i>
Troops, they were in general many
<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>Degrees worse, but the Officers in particular,
who were composed of Blacksmiths,
Taylors, Shoemakers, and all the Banditti
that Country affords, insomuch, that the
other Parts of the Army held them in scorn.
And for Engineers, Bombardiers, and Gunners,
worse never bore the Name, or could
be picked out of all <i>Europe</i>.
</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>
Amongst the ten Engineers, there was
but one who ever saw a Siege (and that was
the simple Siege of <i>Gibraltar</i>) and he was
killed at <i>Boccachica</i>, in the midst of his own
defenceless Works; so that the rest may justly
have been said to be left without a Head.
As for the Bombardiers and Gunners, the
Colonel commanding the Train was in his
grand Climacterick, and consequently very
unfit to be sent upon this Expedition; but
he, poor Gentleman, was soon dispatched
(thanks to the Ignorance of the Engineers)
and his Successor took care to render himself
as unfit for Duty, by Excess of Drinking,
as Old Age rendered the other; and as
to Inferiors of both Sorts, Bombardiers and
Cannoneers, many of them were Country
Fellows, who told the General they were
provided for in the Train for voting for
Mr. &#8212;&#8212; and Mr. such a one, <i>&#38;c.</i> Out of
these few that were good, by constant Attendance
<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>and Duty's falling hard few were
left, and indeed they had not many Opportunities
of shewing their Abilities, the Materials
they were provided withal being mostly
bad; for two thirds of the Bomb-Shells either
broke short in the Air, or their Fusees
went out, and they never broke at all; nor
were there one in three of the Grenadoes
would burst; the Shells were so thick, and
the Cavity so small, they would not hold
Powder sufficient to crack them; nay, so
little Care was taken in providing and packing
up proper Materials for a Train of Artillery,
that out of eight Pieces of Battering-Cannon-Principals,
one was found defective
and unserviceable, and the Expedition had
like to have set forward, without a Plank
or Joist for Platforms for the Guns, or any
Bill-Hooks to cut Fascines and clear the
Ground, had not Lord <i>Cathcart</i> been informed
these Things were wanting, and
wrote timely to have them supplied before
the Fleet sailed, which lay then at <i>St.
Hellens</i>.
</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>
Upon the whole, the Service that has
been performed best demonstrates the Goodness
of this Army: How much it has suffered,
as well as the Reputation of the Nation,
<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>by the Death of Lord <i>Cathcart</i>, the
End of the Expedition must resolve.
</p>

<p>
Thus much may be said in Behalf of
the common Soldiers, though they were
raw and undisciplined, they wanted not for
Courage and Resolution becoming <i>Englishmen</i>.

<a href="#noterefA"><sup>[<i>A</i>]</sup></a>When Captain <i>Dandridge</i>, of the <i>Wolf</i>, came into
the Fleet, he acquainted the Admiral, that the Marquis <i>D'Antin</i>
and twelve Ships of War were then in <i>Port Louis</i>, which was the
Reason the Admiral pursued his Course up to the Isle of <i>Vache</i>,
where when the Fleet arrived, a <i>French</i> Officer coming on board
the <i>Weymouth</i>, told, the Marquis <i>D'Antin</i> was gone Home:
Upon the Admiral's being informed of this, he sent Captain
<i>Knowles</i> up in the <i>Spence</i> Sloop to reconnoitre, who
returned with Answer, that there was but one Ship of War in <i>Port
Louis</i>, and that the rest were all light Merchant Ships; however the
Admiral chose to be more certain, and having an Opportunity of sending
an Answer to the <i>French</i> Officer's Message, the next Day sent
Captain <i>Knowles</i> and Captain <i>Boscawen</i> ashore to the
Governor, who being politely received, and satisfied with their
Remarks, returned in the Evening to the Admiral, and confirmed the
foregoing Observation, who, without loss of Time, carried the Fleet
where they could best and speediest be watered.
</p>

<a name="noteB">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefB"><sup>[<i>B</i>]</sup></a> This Success was obtained by the Loss only of six Men aboard
the <i>Norfolk</i> and <i>Russell</i>, but the <i>Shrewsbury</i>'s
Cable being shot (before her other Anchor could be veered aground) she
met with worse Luck: She drove so far as to open the whole Fire of the
Castle of <i>Boccachica</i>, four of the Enemy's Ships of sixty and
seventy Guns, that were moored athwart the Harbour's Mouth, the Battery
of St. <i>Joseph</i>, and two Fascine Batteries, that were on the
<i>Barradera</i> Side; all this Fire she lay singly exposed to till
dark, when she took the Benefit of the Land-Wind, and ran off, being
greatly shattered in her Hull, Masts, and Rigging, and a great many Men
killed and wounded.
</p>

<a name="noteC">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefC"><sup>[<i>C</i>]</sup></a> It was a Body of eight hundred Grenadiers that first landed,
who, during the Time that more Troops were sent for (which was upwards
of two Hours before they came) were kept in the Boats, within twenty
Yards of the Shore, and so closely crouded, scarce one Man could have
used his Arms, that had they had any Enemy to have dealt with, but
dastardly <i>Spaniards</i>, they must and would have been cut all to
pieces.
</p>

<a name="noteD">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefD"><sup>[<i>D</i>]</sup></a> During the first three Days the Troops were ashore, they
were employed in no one Thing, no not so much as to clear the Ground
for their Encampment, but kept under Arms Night and Day (where, by the
Heat of the Sun, on a white burning Sand, they were scorched to Death,
and by the Inclemency of the Dews in the Night, they got Colds, so that
many of them fell sick) whereas had they been instantly employed to
have encamped and opened Ground in the Woods for that Purpose, they
would have been shaded by the Trees, freed from the burning Heat of the
Sand, and many of them preserved from the Enemy's Shot, that missed our
Battery.
</p>

<a name="noteE">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefE"><sup>[<i>E</i>]</sup></a> In the first Place it must be observed, that there never was
Application made what particular Ordnance, Stores, <i>&#38;c.</i> to land,
or any Scheme formed what Sort of Cannon might be necessary, or what
Quantity of Stores wanting, but the whole was landed, and a
considerable Part lost by being washed off the Beach by the Sea, and
several Carriages broke to pieces by the Enemy's Shot, and the rest
left in Heaps in the utmost Confusion; notwithstanding there were near
five hundred Seamen appointed for this Purpose; but those Officers,
whose Business it was to have formed an Artillery Park (though God
knows they called this so) and disposed of the Stores in a regular
Manner and Order, were&#8212;&#8212;
</p>

<a name="noteF">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefF"><sup>[<i>F</i>]</sup></a> Such was the Knowledge of the Sub-Engineers, that not one of
them knew where to chuse out a Spot of Ground for raising a Battery,
neither had they prepared Fascines, Pickets, or any Materials, till
their Principal arrived (and after he had pitched on a Place, he made a
Demand of thirty thousand Fascines of twelve Foot long, twenty thousand
of nine Foot long, and forty thousand Pickets, whereas one thousand
five hundred Fascines built the Battery) who, <i>Vauban</i> like, would
not begin to work, till all his Materials were on the Spot; and then,
with five hundred Seamen, two or three hundred Blacks, and as many
Soldiers as the General could spare for Pioneers, he was ten Days
erecting a Battery; and when it was done, it was parallel to neither
Face nor Curtain of the Fortification, and the Breach was made in the
angular Point of the Bastion, neither was there any safe Communication
with it, for no Trench was ever cut, or proposed, only a Path through
the Woods, and that almost in a strait Line; so that every Shot
enfiladed it, and killed twenty times the Number of Men going to and
from the Battery, that were killed every where else during the Siege;
nor would the Engineer be prevailed on (any more than the General) to
cut off the Communication from the Town to <i>Boccachica</i> (by which
they might have prevented the Enemy from receiving any Succours by
Land, seen all their Motions in the Harbour, and hindered any
Incursions from the Castle) notwithstanding the Admiral frequently
solicited the General and wrote to him to have it done.
</p>

<a name="noteG">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefG"><sup>[<i>G</i>]</sup></a> This Thing, called a Bomb-Battery, was also a Mark of the
Genius and Understanding of the Engineers. It was a Platform, laid
behind a small rising Rock, open on all Sides, no Communication to it,
either by Trench, Epaulment, or any Security whatsoever, that the Enemy
saw every Man (from the Castle) that went in, or out, as they were
obliged to pass over high Ground, to come at the Battery, and then it
lay quite exposed to the <i>Barradera</i> Battery; so that the Shot
fired from thence passed in at one End, and out at the other; and if
they did no Execution there, were sure to do some in the Camp. And as
to the Usefulness of it, and the Service that was performed by the
excellent bombardiers, every idle Spectator was a Judge; though it was
oftentimes observed, by Order, that not six Shells out of forty had
done Execution, and that, on the contrary, scarce one of forty of the
Enemy's ever missed.
</p>

<a name="noteH">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefH"><sup>[<i>H</i>]</sup></a> The Camp (it has been observed before) was pitched on a low
Sand, but being sheltered (as a direct Object) from the
<i>Barradera</i> Battery, by the Rock that <i>St. Philip</i> stood on,
could not be seen, but lying in the Line of Direction of the Shot fired
from thence, at the famous Bomb-Battery, was sure to be flanked by
every Shot, which missed that, and though it might be prudent to try
Movings, on this Occasion, yet it was a bad Example to the Soldiers,
especially when the Chiefs moved off first, and the Thing was done
without regular and publick Orders; besides the Time it took up at that
Conjuncture (when more material Works were in Hand, and the Army
lessening every Day by Sickness, which was not to be regained.) Whereas
had the Encampment been formed at first, a few Yards up in the Woods,
none of the Enemy's Guns could have been brought to bear on it, nor
indeed would they have been able to have discovered where it was;
besides the great Advantage of Men's being cool, and particularly after
working; but, as it was placed, instead of a cool Retreat, to retire to
Rest, after being heated by the warm Labour, their Tents were a hotter.
</p>

<a name="noteI">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefI"><sup>[<i>I</i>]</sup></a> The following Captains were also ordered upon this
Expedition, vix. Capt. <i>Watson</i>, <i>Coates</i>, <i>Lawrence</i>,
<i>Coleby</i>, and <i>Laws</i>, and all the Barges and Pinnaces of the
Fleet. They went away from their Ships about Midnight, and rowed pretty
far to Leeward, to avoid being seen, or the Noise of their Oars heard,
and proposed landing in a small sandy Bay, behind the <i>Barradera</i>
Battery, into which was a narrow Channel, between two Reefs of Rocks,
and a four Gun Battery on the Strand, facing the Channel (both unknown
to every Person there) which, so soon as some of the Boats had got into
the Channel, began to fire on them; but the brave Tars landed, and
rushed in at the Embrazures, and took Possession of the Battery, before
the Enemy could fire a second Time. This firing alarmed the
<i>Barradera</i> Battery, and the Enemy turned three Pieces of Canon on
the Platform, which they fired with Grape Shot, so soon as the Seamen
advanced; but notwithstanding that, and the Difficulties and Badness of
the Road (which was through a Morass, and where but one Man could walk
abreast, and full of Stumps of Mangroves each a Foot or more high, the
Seamen attacked it; and, after a smart though short Resistance, carried
it, took nine Prisoners, spiked up fifteen Guns (from eighteen to
twenty four Pounders) burned the Carriages, Platforms, Guard-houses,
and Magazine; and it may with Justice be allowed (from the many
Difficulties that attended this Action, in Regard to the advantageous
Situation of the <i>Barradera</i> Battery, the Boats being surprised
with a four Gun Battery, just as they were going to land, and no Person
acquainted with the Place) as bold and surprising an Enterprise, as is
to be met with; and the Consternation it put the Enemy in seems to
confirm this Opinion; for although <i>Boccachica</i> Castle, and the
Enemy's four Ships, were not more than Musket Shot off, yet neither
they, nor <i>St. Joseph</i>'s (which was still nearer) ever fired a
Shot. So that it seems as if they could not believe the Thing, though
they saw all in Flames. For this gallant Action the Admiral rewarded
every common Man with a Dollar apiece.
</p>

<a name="noteK">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefK"><sup>[<i>K</i>]</sup></a> The Success of this Action may be said to have given the
Army both Spirits and Pleasure (<i>pro tempore</i>) as it freed them
from the greatest Annoyance of their Camp, and gave them an Opportunity
of working quietly on their Battery.
</p>

<a name="noteL">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefL"><sup>[<i>L</i>]</sup></a> Because the Enemy made such quick Dispatch in repairing some
Part of the <i>Barradera</i> Battery, mounting and firing some Pieces
again, the Army began to reflect, and say, the Battery was not
effectually destroyed, though hundreds of Men were seen constantly at
work, and Boats with Cannon, Stores, and Fascines, passing and
repassing hourly, both from <i>Boccachica</i> and the Ships: But the
Truth was, the Army was not accustomed to work in that brisk Manner:
No! Working was no Part of their Trade. However, when the sixty Gun
Ship went in against the Battery, that the Enemy was obliged to bring
their Guns to fire at her, the Army cooled in their Resentments, and
all was well, while the Enemy was quiet.
</p>

<a name="noteM">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefM"><sup>[<i>M</i>]</sup></a> This grand Affair having taken up near a Fortnight in
raising, and many more Men employed to work, than was necessary (for
there were five hundred Seamen, between two and three hundred Blacks,
besides as many Pioneers as could be spared out of the Army) much
Execution may be expected therefrom: But alas! the Engineers would by
no Means outdo themselves; the Battery was constructed in a Wood! and
no more Ground was cleared, than a Space necessary for so stupendous a
Building (lest the Enemy should see the Army!). For so great Caution
was used, that before the Wood in the Front of the Battery was cut
down, it was a Doubt, whether any Guns could be brought to bear on the
Castle; and as it was, no Guns could be brought to play on the Enemy's
Shipping, although it was expected they would instantly fire on the
Battery, and be capable of doing it the greatest Damage; (which they
did) and had not an Epaulment been thrown up at the East End, every
Shot from the Ships must have raked the Battery, and destroyed Numbers
of Men. The Army allowed the Tars behaved gallantly; for it must be
remarked, they had Seamen to fight the Guns in the Battery, as well as
help to build it. Whether the Engineers proposed to batter the angular
Point of the Bastion in Breach is Matter of Doubt, at the first laying
out of their Battery; (but infinite Reasons may be assigned for the
Absurdity, besides that great one, of having the Fire of two Flanks to
destroy, instead of one) however it is generally believed, it was
Hap-hazard; for the most impartial Judges in the Navy and Army agree,
if the Enemy had cut down eighty or an hundred Paces of the Woods
further round the Castle, the Undertaking would have been so difficult,
as to have shocked the Science of all the Engineers, if not quite
disheartened them, from so daring an Enterprise.
</p>

<a name="noteN">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefN"><sup>[<i>N</i>]</sup></a> The Position the Enemy had lain their Ships in, was beyond
all Doubt the most advantageous, could be formed by Man; both for
opposing any Attempt, that might be made by Shipping on the Entrance
into the Harbour; or annoy any Battery, that could be raised ashore;
and as they found no Battery against them, they failed not to play as
briskly (as <i>Spaniards</i> will do when there is no body to hurt
them) and did ten times more Damage than the Castle.
</p>

<a name="noteO">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefO"><sup>[<i>O</i>]</sup></a> These Ships were ordered to cannonade purely to oblige the
General, who, because the Enemy's Ships fired at his Battery, desired
the Admiral would send Ships to cannonade the Castle, though there was
a Battery of twenty Guns to fire against five or six (for that was all
the Castle could bring to bear on the Battery) so they had their Masts
and Yards shot to pieces, and Numbers of Men killed and wounded,
without doing any other Damage than beating down the Rubbish; (which
the Battery would have done in half the Time, as being twice as near)
for they could not come to hurt the Enemy's Ships, nor did it divert
their Ships from firing at the Battery.

<a href="#noterefP"><sup>[<i>P</i>]</sup></a> So soon as the Enemy saw the Boats coming to Land, and these
Ships come to an Anchor close to the Battery, they deserted it, and
spiked up the Guns; but Captain <i>Watson</i>, and Captain
<i>Coates</i> marched into it, and ripped up the Platforms, burned them
and the Carriages, and effectually demolished the Battery: The Enemy
fired at them from their Shipping, but with-out much Damage.

<a href="#noterefQ"><sup>[<i>Q</i>]</sup></a> It may be remarked as something extraordinary, that although
the Army thought the Breach just practicable, they should entirely
cease firing, the Night before they intended the Attack; as it is a
sort of an established Rule in all regular Sieges, to keep firing in
the Night, to prevent the Enemy's removing the Rubbish, that is beat
down in the Day, which the Enemy would certainly have done, if they had
been sufficiently strong; for they began that Night a Counter-Battery
of Fascines on the Ramparts, in order to have disputed it longer, which
if they had had Time to have finished, and Numbers to have carried on
both Works together, (<i>viz.</i>) moving the Rubbish from the Foot of
the Breach, and compleating these Counter-Batteries, they would have
rendered the Attack as difficult as from the Beginning.

<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefR"><sup>[<i>R</i>]</sup></a> The Army having sent in the Night to reconnoitre the Breach,
and judging it surmountable, resolved this Evening to attack it, and
after having made their necessary Dispositions, sent off to acquaint
the Admiral with their Design, and that so soon as three Shells should
be thrown in the Evening by way of Signal, the Battery should begin to
fire warmly, till the Soldiers were almost at the Foot of the Breach,
and then to cease, and they rush in, which had the desired Effect; for
on the Battery's playing, the Enemy retired off their Ramparts, except
only one Centinel, and he hid himself behind some Fascines; that the
Troops mounted the Breach undiscovered, and were actually huzzaing on
the Ramparts, and hoisting the <i>English</i> Flag, before the Enemy
were apprised of them; who made the best of their Way out of their
Castle Gate, excepting two, who were taken Prisoners; so that there was
not a Musket fired in Opposition, nor a Gun from any of the Enemy's
Ships, which is both astonishing and remarkable, as their Broadsides
lay to the Castle, and the Admiral (Don <i>Blass</i>) was aboard. But
such was the Panick they were in, that happy was he that could get
first into a Boat to save himself: (and the Don did not look behind
him). Each Ship was scuttled ready for sinking, and had a large square
Plug in the Hole; but the <i>St. Philip</i>'s People not readily
getting them out, set fire to her; the <i>Africa</i> and <i>St.
Carlos</i> were sunk, as it was intended the <i>Galicia</i> should
also, in order to prevent any Ship's getting through the Channel, which
(had the Scheme been effected) would have rendered it difficult to
pass, if practicable at all, without weighing some one or other of the
Ships. This Victory (it will readily be allowed) gave the Army a great
Share of Spirits, as it freed them from Hardships (modern Gentlemen
Soldiers are not used to) and gave them Possession of an Island (as
well as the Castle) in which the Enemy could not come to disturb them,
especially while they had got a Fleet of Ships of War to attend on
them; for, to their great Glory be it spoken, they could not venture to
move along Shore without Men of War to attend on them, as they marched,
and the constant Cry was, <i>Why don't you come to our Assistance?</i>
Nay, so great a Liking had they to the Sea, that they could not find
their Way into the Castle, after the Breach was made, without a Sea
Pilot to conduct them; and what is worth Notice is, he was a
<i>Spaniard</i>, and a Prisoner; but the General imagined, he might be
as good a Pilot by Land, as by Sea, and so sent to the Admiral, to
desire he might shew the Troops the Way into the Castle.

<a name="noteS">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefS"><sup>[<i>S</i>]</sup></a> The Admiral's Scheme for Attacking <i>St. Joseph</i>'s had
drawn all the Attention of the Enemy that Way; for so soon as they saw
the Boats going to Land, their Ships began to fire pretty briskly, and
<i>St. Joseph</i>'s Battery fired also; but as the Bushes prevented
their seeing the Men, they did but little Harm. The Enemy sent several
large Boats full of Men from their Ships into the Battery, which is
pretty plain they did not expect <i>Boccachica</i> would have been
attacked at that Time, or consequently they would not have sent them
there. (Wherefore it is evident, this Scheme facilitated the Army's
becoming Masters of <i>Boccachica</i>, and put an End to the Dispute
sooner than was expected, or could possibly have happened, had any
Nation but pusillanimous <i>Spaniards</i> had the Defence of it; for
had the Place been defended equal to its Strength and excellent
Disposition, both of the Ships and Batteries, it would have been a
difficult Task for the Fleet and Army both to have rendered themselves
Masters of it.) But so soon as they saw the Castle taken, they made the
best of their Way off, in what Boats they could get, and abandoned St.
<i>Joseph</i>'s likewise, leaving only one drunken Man behind (who was
to have blown it up) so soon as the Boats had got Possession. Captain
<i>Coates</i> was left to command this Fort, and the Captains
<i>Knowles</i> and <i>Watson</i> went aboard the <i>Galicia</i>, where
they found the Captain of her, and about sixty Men, whom they took
Prisoners, and carried aboard of the Admiral, the rest of the Crew
having run away with the Boats, and prevented their escaping and
sinking their Ship, as was intended.

that come from <i>Tolu</i> and <i>Sina</i> must pass; and here the
Enemy had erected two small Batteries, one of four Guns, the other of
eight, which were demolished by the <i>Weymouth</i> and <i>Cruiser</i>.
The latter was sent up the Creek, to bring away five or six <i>Sina</i>
Hulks (Vessels so called, as being dug out of one solid Tree, and big
enough ordinarily to carry twenty Tuns) that lay there, which were very
useful to the Fleet in watering.

<a href="#noterefV"><sup>[<i>V</i>]</sup></a> Between <i>Castillo Grande</i> and <i>Mancinilla</i> Fort
is a large Channel, that goes up as it were into another Harbour or
large Bason; in the Middle of the Channel is a Shoal, that divides it
into two Channels; on each Side the Shoal the Enemy had moored Ships,
and sunk them; and in the Channel next the Castle had moored two sixty
Gun Ships, the <i>Conquestodore</i> and <i>Dragon</i>, and untiled
their Houses in the Castle, as if intended to defend it; but observing
the Boats sounding, and well knowing how near the Ships could lay their
Broadsides against it, they certainly judged right in abandoning it,
and sinking their Ships, as they must have lost many Men in defending
them, and those that had happened to have been left, after the Castle
and Ships had been taken, must have submitted to have been Prisoners;
for there was no Way of their escaping, either by Land or Water; and as
their Numbers were not great, it was best collecting them in one Body,
and at one Place, to make an Effort.
</p>

<a name="noteW">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefW"><sup>[<i>W</i>]</sup></a> Though this Castle was capable of making a pretty good
Defence, yet the above Reasons justify the Enemy in abandoning it.
There was in the Castle fifty seven Guns, which the Enemy had spiked
up, and the Powder they had thrown into the Cistern of Water, and
spoiled, but most of the Guns were got clear again, and the Castle was
garisoned with one hundred regular Troops, and about fifty Seamen.

used as an Hospital Ship, to receive the Enemy's wounded, and served to
carry them to Town, or fetch Ammunition, or Stores, from the Castle, as
Occasion required, and, to prevent her being destroyed by the
<i>English</i>, the Enemy chose rather to burn her.

<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefY"><sup>[<i>Y</i>]</sup></a> All the Boats of the Fleet having been ordered to hold
themselves in Readiness for landing the Forces, each respective
Transport was to shew a Signal Light at Midnight, where the Boats went
and received the several Regiments according as directed, and from
thence went and rendezvoused aboard the <i>Weymouth</i> till dawn of
Day; and after her scouring the Woods briskly with Grape-Shot,
<i>&#38;c.</i> at half an Hour past four o'Clock in the Morning they were
landed at a Place called <i>Gratia</i>, formerly a Country House hired
by the <i>South-Sea</i> Factors, and one <i>Mac Pherson</i>, who had
also been in that Company's Service, and was well acquainted with the
Country, was their Guide. But, as throughout the whole, Things were
done without Order or Method, so they went on still; for
notwithstanding the Army had been apprised of the Enemy's having made
Lodgments along the Road, yet they landed without a Grenado Shell, or a
Field-Piece, and were likewise told, the Road was even and able to
sustain the Weight of the heaviest Cannon. However, Providence
continued to favour them better than their own Prudence could have
guided, and happily they were landed with the Loss only of one Man, and
two or three wounded, although some Parties of the Enemy attacked them
twice: At which Time the Ships proved of great Service, as they could
see every Motion the Enemy made, and fired among them very
successfully; for no sooner did they attempt to make a Stand and draw
up, than the Shot dispersed them, and swept off Numbers; so that if the
Army had vouchsafed to have pushed their Success, it is a general
received Opinion (even amongst themselves now) they might have rendered
themselves Masters of the Castle of <i>St. Lazare</i> that Day (even
without Field-Pieces) for the whole Force of the Town was out against
them (as they were told by some Prisoners they took and some Deserters)
and very impolitically divided into several Bodies; and in the Panick
they were in, and each Party running different Ways, it would have been
no difficult Task, to have rendered themselves Masters of that small
Redoubt, if not succeeded in forcing the City Gates; for what had they
to do, but to follow the Enemy close at their Heels, and slaughter
them? Before they had got into the Town, the other must; for when they
were mixed in a Body amongst their Enemy, the Town dared not venture to
have fired, for fear of killing their own People; but instead of making
Use of any of these Advantages, they contented themselves in taking
Possession of the Ground the Enemy had left them Masters of, and there
posted their Advanced Guards, and retired with the main Body behind
<i>La Papa</i> to encamp; and here almost as many Days were spent in
forming an Encampment, as at <i>Boccachica</i>.

<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefZ"><sup>[<i>Z</i>]</sup></a> <i>La Papa</i> is a Convent, which stands on the Top of the

for observing the Enemy's Motions, as it overlooked the Town and
Country for many Leagues round about.

<a name="noteAA">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefAA"><sup>[<i>A</i>]</sup></a> Though it might have been expected from the Loss and
Destruction of Ordnance Stores at <i>Boccachica</i>, more Care would
have been taken here, yet, instead of that, the worthy Officer of the
Train doubled his Neglect, and Things were in much more Disorder and
Confusion than they were there, notwithstanding here was Choice of
Ground to pitch upon for an Artillery Park; but it was too much Trouble
and Labour to move the Stores from the Place where they were first put
down in, at landing, and required more Attendance than could be spared
from the Bottle (and it is a well known Proverb, <i>When the Shepherd's
away, the Flock will stray</i>,) so that out of two or three hundred
Men, that were appointed to attend this Service, it was well if thirty
were found at Work.

<a href="#noterefBB"><sup>[<i>B</i>]</sup></a> When the Army landed, there were scarce any Works worth
Notice round the Castle of <i>St. Lazare</i>, but a Fascine Battery of
five Guns\ on the North Side of the Hill (which was built the Year
before, when Admiral <i>Vernan</i> bombarded the Town) and was of no
Service, but in Case of Approaches being made that Way. But as the
Enemy saw the Army (disposed to Rest rather than Work) go on slowly,
they took Occasion to improve their Time, and with unwearied Diligence
set to Work, and in three Days Time completed a four Gun Battery, and
entrenched themselves in Lines round about the Foot of the Castle,
which were stronger, and of much more Importance, than the Castle
itself, and drew those Guns off the Fascine Battery on the North Port,
and mounted them in this new Battery, and saluted the Army frequently
with them, whilst they were working on their Bomb-Battery and Lodgment
for their Advanced Guards.
</p>

<a name="noteCC">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefCC"><sup>[<i>C</i>]</sup></a> It has been remarked, that neither General nor Engineer
could be prevailed on to cut off the Communication, notwithstanding the
Admiral represented the Necessity thereof, as the most sure Means to
distress the Enemy, and had sent the <i>Dunkirk</i> to anchor off the
<i>Boguilla</i>, to prevent any Embarkation bringing Supplies by Water,
as he had done the <i>Falmouth</i> at the grand <i>Baru</i>, on the
Outside of <i>Passa Cavallos</i> (before the taking of
<i>Boccachica</i>) which effectually prevented any Refreshments coming
to the Enemy from <i>Tolu</i>, and the River <i>Sina</i>, their
principal Markets; yet nothing was of Weight enough for its being done
here, although so very easy, and the Army were complaining heavily, for
want of Refreshments, and yet suffered Supplies daily to go into the
Town. The <i>Boguilla</i> is the Mouth of the Lake (behind
<i>Carthagena</i>) that opens into the Sea, where the Enemy kept a
Guard of about an hundred Men, and was the only Way possibly they had
left for Supplies to come to them; and though fresh Provisions were
scarce in the Camp, and would have been exceedingly beneficial to the
Sick, yet so little Pains did the Army care to take to get it, that
when the General was acquainted, that a Drove of three or four hundred
Head of Oxen were going along the Strand, he did not dispatch a Party
to intercept them, or endeavour to cut them off, not in three Hours
after he had been informed of the Thing, and then the Cattle were going
into the Town. But so far were the Army from being disposed to cut off
the Communication on that Side, that they were continually forming
Ideas of the Enemy's coming that Way to attack them, and that they were
actually raising Batteries on some of the Islands in the Lake, to drive
them out of the Camp, and could not be convinced to the contrary, till
the Admiral ordered a large Canoe to be carried over Land, and launched
into the Lake, which was manned and armed, and an Officer of the
<i>Weymouth</i> and a Land Officer sent in her round the Lake, to
reconnoitre; upon whose Return, those dreadful Apprehensions were
dissipated.

<a name="noteDD">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefDD"><sup>[<i>D</i>]</sup></a> From the first Sight of the <i>American</i> troops they were
despised, and as many of them were <i>Irish</i>, (suspected Papists)
were never employed till now; but as Sickness encreased amongst the
others (and hourly Attacks expected from the Enemy) it was thought
expedient to have them ashore; and though it is most certain, there was
scarce one but knew what Opinion had been conceived of them, nay indeed
told them, that had not the Fellows been better than they were taken
for, it was enough to have exasperated them to have deserted. The other
Soldiers of Lord <i>James Cavendish</i> and Col. <i>Bland</i>'s
Regiments were as good Troops as any on the Expedition; and after this
Reinforcement, it was expected the Communication would have been
immediately cut off; (as it had been suggested Numbers could not be
spared before) but so far from that, that the Army still complained,
that they had not Men enough to relieve their Guards; and indeed,
according to the Number they mounted, <i>Marlborough</i>'s Army would
scarce have been sufficient; for the Advance Guard consisted of five
hundred Men, the Picket eight hundred, besides several other Out-Guards
of one hundred, and some fifty; whereas the Enemy had but one Guard
(that faced this Way) without their Work, and that of seven Men only.
Thus were the poor Wretches harassed.

<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefEE"><sup>[<i>E</i>]</sup></a> When the Council of War met, several of the general Officers
and Colonels dissented from this Resolution, as judging it too rash an
Undertaking, without a proper Breach being made first, or at least
before the Place had been well reconnoitred; but in order to solve this
last Difficulty, there were several Deserters that offered to go as
Guides, and three of the most intelligent were pitched upon.

</p>

<a name="noteGG">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefGG"><sup>[<i>G</i>]</sup></a> After the Majority of the Council of War had determined on
the Attack, a proper Time was now the Question, as to which the
Deserters informed them, about two o'Clock in the Morning would be the
best Time; for the Guards from the Town that nightly patroled round the
Foot of the Hill would by that Time be returned and gone to their
respective Homes; because as Duty went hard (their Numbers being but it
was customary for them, as soon as they had performed their Rout, to go
to Bed;) and further observed, that when a <i>Spaniard</i> has laid
himself down to sleep, it is no easy Task to raise him to fight; but
these Arguments were of no Force to the General; just before Day was
his Time; accordingly, about four o'Clock in the Morning the Attack
began, and a Party of Grenadiers, along with Colonel <i>Grant</i>,
entered the Trenches at the Foot of the Castle; but not being
sustained, were cut off, and Colonel <i>Grant</i> shot through the
Body. After this, instead of rushing in, Sword in Hand, and mingling
with the Enemy in the Trenches, a full Stop was made, and the Men stood
firing in Plotoons; those that had Room, and could wheel off for
others, did, but the greatest Part stood and fired all their Ammunition
away, while the Enemy (as it was now Day-light, and they could take
Aim) were mowing them down, like Grass, with their Cannon, Musketry,
and Grenadoes; notwithstanding which, the Troops faced them like Lions,
and wanted but to have been led on, or told what they were to have
done, and they certainly would have taken the Place. But, instead of
that, from the most excellent Disposition that was made, no Officer
attempted to lead them on, and the Grenado Shells, that should have
been in the Front, and distributed among the Soldiers, were in Boxes in
the Rear; nor was there one Length of lighted Match among them. The
Woolpacks and Scaling Ladders were also in the Rear. But when Colonel
<i>Grant</i> entered the Trenches, such Call was made for them, that
some few were carried up the Hill; however as he, poor Gentleman, fell,
no body else tried to make Use of them; and so amongst other Things
they were left for the Enemy. As this Scheme was but badly formed from
the Beginning, (and indeed may be properly called the General's own
Scheme) so it as unfortunately ended; for the Admiral not being
acquainted with this Resolution of the Council of War, (either by
Letter or Message) had not an Opportunity of acting in Conjunction with
them, and assisting them with a Body of Seamen, as it is evident he
would have done; for as soon as he was acquainted the Fort was
attacked, and got up and saw the Troops at a Stand, the Instant a
Signal could be seen, (at Dawn of Day) he made one for all the Boats in
the Fleet manned and armed, and sent them with orders to follow the
General's Directions; but it was too late; before they got ashore, the
Troops were returned from the Attack.
</p>

<p class="foot">
Various are the Accounts of the Loss sustained in this Action; but it
is generally believed, there were upwards of one hundred Men killed,
and near two hundred wounded, thirty of whom were taken Prisoners,
Numbers of Arms, Colours, Drums, Woolpacks, Grenadoes, Pick-axes,
Shovels, Scaling Ladders, <i>&#38;c.</i> were left behind in the Retreat,
which the Enemy arrogantly diverted themselves withal, for some Time,
on the Top of the Hill, taking Care to let the Army see them.
</p>

<p class="foot">
As when Faults are committed, the first Thing sought after is an
Excuse; so, not succeeding in this Attack, the Army now fell to blaming
the Guides, saying, they had led them the wrong Way; the Guides again
say, the Army would not follow them the Way they would have led them;
but had Reason alone been their Guide, sure they should have attacked
the Castle on the weakest Side; (for they all knew one Side was
defenceless) whereas they attacked it on the strongest Side, where the
Hill was most difficult of Access; and when they found themselves
repulsed, and at a Loss what to do, the speedier they had made their
Retreat, the smaller had been their Loss.

<p class="foot">
<a href="#noterefHH"><sup>[<i>H</i>]</sup></a> The Admiral had sent several Officers in to sound, and try
if Ships might come near enough to batter, who all gave it, as their
Opinions, that there could not more than three Ships possibly anchor at
the upper End of the Harbour; and if they were laid but in a Foot Water
more than they drew, they would not be in a Point-Blank-Shot, and
consequently could do no material Execution; however, to convince the
General, that Ships could be of no manner of Service to him, the
Admiral caused the <i>Galicia</i> (one of the <i>Spanish</i> Ships) to
be fitted proper for battering, by forming, between each Port, Merlons
(or Cases) of six Foot thick, and filled with rammed Earth or Sand, and
sent her in to cannonade the Town; but it was soon found, she could not
come hear enough to do any Service; for the enemy had demolished her
so, in two or three Hours, that she would have sunk in half an Hour
more, if she had not been drawn off; and it may be established as a
general Rule, for Ships to go by, that unless they can come within half
a Musket or Pistol Shot of a Fortification, it will have the Advantage
of them, for the further you lye off, the more Guns they can bring to
bear against you; whereas, when you go so near, there can no more Guns
annoy you, than are mounted within the Length of your Ship; and the
Difference of Briskness in firing, betwixt a Ship and a Fort, is so
great, besides the Odds in Number of Guns, that it is impossible to
withstand a Ship long. After this Experiment the <i>Galicia</i> was
burned.

being at their Heels, many of them left their Baggage, and Numbers of
them their Tents and Arms, which the Enemy came the next Morning and
picked up. The Tents they pitched upon <i>St. Lazare</i> Hill, and
other Places, where they might best be seen, and by a Flag of Truce
that had Occasion to pass the next Day, about Exchange of Prisoners,
they failed not to express their Astonishment at the precipitate
Retreat of the Army. Thus ended this famous Expedition, that was the
